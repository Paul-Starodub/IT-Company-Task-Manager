# it-company-task-manager
You have a team of Developers, Designers, Project Managers & QA specialists. Also you have a lot of tasks connected with IT-sphere. But somehow you still haven't heard anything about Trello or ClickUp. So, you decided to implement your own Task Manager, which will handle all possible problems during product development in your team. Everyone from the team can create Task, assign this Task to team-members, and mark the Task as done (of course, better before the deadlines)
